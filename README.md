# Phase diagram

![Phase diagram](phase_diagram_water.png)

A simple script to plot phase diagrams.

A phase diagram in physical chemistry, engineering, mineralogy, and materials science is a type of chart used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.)  at which thermodynamically distinct phases (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states)  occur and coexist at equilibrium. [More details on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram).

Peter Atkins defines in his  book *Physical Chemistry* that "**phase** identifies a state of matter, not only about the chemical composition, but also concerning its physical state".

# Installation and requirements

This project relies mainly on [SciPy](https://matplotlib.org/), [Matplotlib](https://numpy.org/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Just clone or download this repo. This is not a package yet. We recommend creating a environment and install the requirements from the `Pipfile` file with [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).
